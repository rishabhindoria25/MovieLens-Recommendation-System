# MovieLens-Recommendation-System

This project develops a hybrid recommendation system for the MovieLens 100K dataset, leveraging both traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization and a Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model implemented with PyTorch to learn user-item interactions. The predictions from both models are then combined using an XGBoost meta-learner to enhance the prediction accuracy.
